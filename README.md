## Documentation

[Documentation with examples](https://docs.rs/color-hex) The documentation includes a comprehensive description of the syntax supported for parsing hex colors.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
color_hex = "0.2.0"
```

Here is an example of converting a direct "HTML style" hex color string to an array:

```Rust
use color_hex::color_from_hex;

fn main() {
    let color = color_from_hex!("#2d2d2d");

    println!("Color: {:x?}", color);
}
```
